## Portfolio for Tessa Carlson

## Description
The website was created from scratch for a weekly challenge in coding boot camp. The point of this project is to start a portfolio for myself to keep updating and creating upon. This site functions as a electronic portfolio for potential employers to view my work and style in hopes of employment.
Some acceptance criteria has not been met such as making the site responsive to various screens and devices. This will be a work in progress and continually updated with more functionality and to showcase my progress.

Acceptance Criteria for website:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Usage
This website is for employers to check out my work experience and get to know me for a possible employment. Used as a quick first look and to show off work potential.

## Roadmap
My plan is to make whole page more responsive to viewport sizes, to fill in more completed projects and to start a blog on my experience while learning to code.

## Authors and acknowledgment
All backgrounds and images were designed and created myself. Various websites were used in assisting with issues, for example:

## Visuals
Website was started with a header and navigation back with clickable links to the h2 headers on the page with a hover and active affect:

Included a hero image background with a portrait of myself and subtitle lined up to the left side of the page vertically. The hero image was created by using Word doc, snipping my name, tiling it in Microsoft Paint and saved as a jpeg:

Created h2 headers to label each of my sections, adjusted them to my liking with the following code:

Each section was then filled in with the information needed and a background set for main. Main back ground was created by using the capital letter 'T' repeatedly in Word doc, snipped and created as a jpeg in Microsoft Paint. Images were made clickable and projects that are deployed will lead you to the deployed site, box one, two and three are placeholder images and boxes for future projects. The contacts section was also made clickable with the same hover and active effects to follow through the page:
