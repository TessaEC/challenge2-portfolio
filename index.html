                            Hello, my name is Tessa Carlson. I grew up in a small town in Iowa but, have lived in Tennessee
                        for 7 years now. I love to try new food and have new adventures however, I also love to curl up with
                        my dog on the couch and relax. I have a passion for passions and love to work hard and be really good
                        at what I do. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            I have always had longevity and devotion with my work places however, they were never
                        something I wanted to do forever. I wanted to put all of my hard-work and go-get-er attitude
                        into something I enjoy. After realizing how diverse my work experience was,
                        I knew I could learn something new and succeed at it. I happened upon Vanderbilt's coding bootcamp webpage
                        and did some research about how it all works. This was when I knew. I knew that this is something I actually
                        WANT to learn and WANT to put the time and effort into something that will actually feel rewarding at the end of the day.
                        I'm so excited and eager to keep learning and do bigger things with my life!
                    </p>
